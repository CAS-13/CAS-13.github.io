          This page shows motor vehicle crashes and community-reported motor vehicle incidents (CRI) between drivers and bicyclists or pedestrians. Click a ward or an incident to get more information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ward risk rating is based on the number of accidents involving bicyclists or pedestrians, taking into account the number of injuries and fatalities, since January 2002.

          <h2>About this map</h2>
          <p>Thematic data for this map were derived from two sources:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Motor vehicle accident data comes from the <a href="https://www.mshp.dps.missouri.gov/MSHPWeb/SAC/stars_index.html">Missouri Statewide Traffic Accident Records System (STARS)</a> managed by the Missouri State Highway Patrol.</li>
            <li>Community-report incidents are collected by members of the community via Esri's Survey123 and managed by the map's author.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Motor vehicle accident data may have a lag in reporting from the date of the accident. Community-reported incidents in this map largely consist of test data recorded in February-March 2024, so few incidents outside of that timeframe have been captured.</p>
					<p>In addition, spatial data for St. Louis's 14 wards, which were updated in 2020, comes from the <a href="https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/data/">City of St. Louis Open Data portal</a>.</p>
